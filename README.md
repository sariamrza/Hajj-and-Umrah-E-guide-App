# Hajj-and-Umrah-E-guide-App
The project is an application for smartphones whose goal is to ease the journey of pilgrims when performing Hajj and Umrah and trying to overcome the difficulties they face. 

Using advanced technologies like Geolocation API, Geofencing API, Watson Assistant API I developed an Android app in the Java programming language using an IDE called Android Studio. 

The application displays different types of information about the rituals must do by the pilgrims based on their location, allows you to measure your progress on your spiritual journey, and convert your mobile to a smart tourist guide. 

The proposed App consists of three main parts: Intelligent guiding system based on the location, a chatbot can answer questions about Hajj and Umrah rituals, and an offline mode which contains a step-by-step Hajj and Umrah guide.
